== TODO ==

* New genomes start with 0 hidden nodes
* The types of mutations are as follows:
    * Weight Mutations (Same as normal GAs)
      Each edge has a chace for meing mutated or not
    * Structure Mutations (2 types)
      * Node additions: An edge is selected and disabled. A node is then inserted and two new edged
        are created. The one preceding the node is givin a weight of 1.0 and the one following the new node
        inhearits the old edges weight. The new geanes each net new innovations numbers.
      * Edge additions: A new edge with a random weight is added between two unconnected nodes
- Crossover
    * Matching neanes are randomly selected from each parent whule the extra geanes are pulled from the more fit parent
    * The distance function says that `distance = (E * c1 / N) + (D * c2 / N) + c3 * <AVG WEIGHT>` where E is the count of excess geanes
      D is the count of disjoint geanes N is the count of geanes in the larger genome and the coeffecents aredefined in a config (Referer to page 109 - 110)

* Selection
* Debug weird freezes when doing tens of thousands of mutations
- While less than 15 genes bias add node operation to older genes
- When repopulating, remove the worse proforming genomes first. Then crossover.
- Look into nuron bias
- Past mutations
* Make system work with inout node counts not vecs of them
- Dont store nodes as real objects just counts?
